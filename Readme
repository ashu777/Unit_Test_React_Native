We are using jest here for unit Testing.

To Check and Add Jest:

When we create a react-native project, by default jest is added .
To check this please go to package.json and check  "test": “jest"  inside  “scripts”.
And  “jest"  dependency  will be there.
If it is not present add jest using command “npm install --save-dev jest ” .

To run all Test Files:

Run the command “npm  run test”  
All the test case results will be shown in terminal.

To run a particular Test File:

Run the Command “npx jest  testfilename”
For e.g=> npx jest App-test.js


Updating Snapshots:
npx jest --updateSnapshot

Test Report Generation:

To Generate Test Report we need to add jest-html-reporter 
To add this run command “npm install --save-dev jest-html-reporter”
And add “reporters” inside  “jest” dependency in  package.json file .

Run the command “npm  run test” and  test report will be generated 
as a file name  called “test-report.html” in the  root of the project.


Code Coverage Rreport Generation:

To Generate Code Coverage report add the below code inside the “jest” dependency .

"collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageReporters": [
      "json",
      "html"
    ],


To Generate Code Coverage Report  of all TestFiles run command “npx jest --coverage”
It  will generate a folder called coverage  in root of the project and inside it 
“index.html” contains the Code Coverage report.

To generate a specific testfile code coverage report:
npx jest --coverage  -- testfilename
